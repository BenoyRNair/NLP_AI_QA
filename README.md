AI based QA System for Game Of Thrones [Qualitative Analysis of different models]

We have an interactive chat bot that can have a conversation (*text based and voice based*) with the user and provide response to factoid type questions on the '[Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones)' television series.

The tool lets you do a qualitative comparison of the following NLP models: [BERT](https://huggingface.co/deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2), [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2), [ELECTRA](https://huggingface.co/deepset/electra-base-squad2), and [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad).

[This notebook](https://github.com/BenoyRNair/NLP_AI_QA) was developed and tested in ***Google Colab***.
